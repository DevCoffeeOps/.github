## MiscOps Organization

This started out as idea for an organization of DevOps practitioners who enjoy building and networking professionally.

## Goals

0. Daily notes program (tracking monotonous activities for printing, like grocery purchases, upcoming bills, job applications, etc.)
0. Couch to 5k self-tracker (meet fitness goals while getting involved with local community events)
1. Create a Build, Release, Run workflow that our community can use.
2. Practice Application development, [DevOps](https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations/dp/1950508404) and [SRE](https://www.amazon.com/Site-Reliability-Workbook-Practical-Implement/dp/1492029505/) for professional development, share demos.
3. Partner with other orgs or non-profits / maybe offer IT consulting.
